The World-Wide Web (WWW), commonly known as the web, was invented to ''to be a pool of human knowledge'' \parencite*[76]{BernersLeeCailliauLuotonenNielsenSecret1994} that could be shared between remote collaborators \parencite{BernersLeeCailliauLuotonenNielsenSecret1994}. HyperText Markup Language (HTML), Cascading Style Sheets (CSS), and JavaScript (JS) are considered the core web technologies \parencite{MajchrzakBiornHansenGronli2018}. The core web technologies that are all being used today were all introduced in just a few years in 1993 to 1996 (Figure \ref{webtechnologies-timeline}).

The very first web page (Figure \ref{world-wide-web}) was written in HTML and relies heavily on hyperlinks \parencite{BernersLeeCailliauGroffPollermann1992}. In 1996 the W3C recommendation on CSS was published \parencite{LieBos1996}. \citeauthor{LieBos1996} describes CSS as a simple mechanism that ''allows authors and readers to attach style (e.g. fonts, colors and spacing) to HTML documents'' \parencite*[1]{LieBos1996} based on CSS rules. JavaScript was introduced in 1995 intended to be used for simple tasks such as client-side form validation or simple animations \parencite{Moller2018}. It's capabilities evolved and led to inventions such as Asynchronous JavaScript and XML (AJAX) \parencite{NielsonWilliamsonArlitt2008} and heavy manipulation of the Document Object Model (DOM) \parencite{WoodLeHorsApparaoByrneChampionIsaacsJacobsNicolRobieSutor1998}.

The introduction and evoluation of JavaScript has lead the evolution of the web browser as a web page reader towards a platform for web applications.
