\section{Problem}
\label{problem}

WebAssembly has been benchmarked previously. \textcite{HaasRossbergSchuffTitzerHolmanGohmanWagnerZakaiBastien2017} used PolyBenchC, \textcite{JangdaPowersGuhaBerger2019} ported BROWSIX \parencite{PowersVilkBerger2017} to WebAssembly and used the SPEC CPU benchmark suite, and \textcite{ReiserBlaser2017} used eight different cases \parencite[Table 1 in][]{ReiserBlaser2017} to compare JavaScript/asm.js and WebAssembly.

This thesis examines the following question: \textbf{In which cases does WebAssembly provide a significant performance improvement?}

The result will be analyzed and evaluated to provide developers with an understanding on where to start when porting real-world frameworks and web applications. To the best of my knowledge no previous research that has addressed the same problem.

\subsection{Hypothesis}

The hypothesis is that there is a significant difference ($\alpha = 0,01$) in performance between WebAssembly and JavaScript/asm.js in test cases that are inherently static and computational intensive.
