Benchmarking is hard. As noted by \textcite{CaiNerurkarWu1998} there are plenty of examples of benchmark cheating either accidentally or on purpose. This pattern is particular prominent in todays race of having the fastest smartphone\footnote{https://www.anandtech.com/show/13318/huawei-benchmark-cheating-headache}. It's thus important to be aware of how benchmarks work and try to avoid mistakes such as dead code, known data sets and shortcuts \parencite{CaiNerurkarWu1998}. It's also important to be aware of what is actually measured and why. As described by \textcite{JangdaPowersGuhaBerger2019} the use of the PolyBenchC benchmark suite used by \textcite{HaasRossbergSchuffTitzerHolmanGohmanWagnerZakaiBastien2017} measures polyhedral loop optimizations which may not be representative of web apps.

%WebAssembly is according to \textcite{HaasRossbergSchuffTitzerHolmanGohmanWagnerZakaiBastien2017} an option to JavaScript with higher performance. Higher performance makes way for demanding/truly high-performing applications/apps.


%- microbenchmarking or Benchmarking the wrong thing

%javascript is actually quite fast these days. due to years of optimization of this part

%20/30\% fasterl, mostly in parse and init time

%future
%garbage collector
%threading 
%host binding

%mvp is current release

%walt a javascript like syntax for webssembly text format

%assemblyscript a typescript to webassembly compiler
 %awaiting gc before it can really become powerful

%javascript performance is not predictable due to the way its intepreted, and one of the goals of %webassembly is to make it more predictable

% make sure to show this unprecitableness in the charts, 33m

%native node modules with webassembly

%javascript will compile direct to wasm in 2019?

%- webassembly is optimized before it hits the browser
